mvrnorm creates multivariate randorm normal distributions. uses mean vector and covariane.

in a function you can use either output or return(whatever) as the last line.

mutate() from dplyr package is an alternative to apply functions. could still use $ instead, unless it's a long statemnt.

apply family is used less and instead dplyr is used more often these days.

. (dot) in for example a do function means whatever passed to me (form the previous statement).

```{r}


```




```{r}



```
